Titanic Survival Insights: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
This project focuses on performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to explore relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends that may have influenced passenger survival.

Project Overview:
The Titanic disaster is one of the most famous shipwrecks in history, and the dataset associated with it provides information about the passengers, such as age, gender, class, and whether they survived. This project aims to:

Clean the dataset by handling missing values and irrelevant columns.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize patterns and trends.
Identify correlations between survival and various factors such as gender, age, class, and fare.
